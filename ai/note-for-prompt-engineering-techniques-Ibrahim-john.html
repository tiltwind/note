<h2 id="chapter-1-introduction-to-prompt-engineering-techniques-介绍">Chapter 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering Techniques (介绍)</h2>
<p>Prompt engineering is the process of creating prompts or asking or
instructions that guide the output of a language model like ChatGPT. </p>
<p>ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model that is capable of generating human-like text. It is built on the transformer architecture, which allows it to handle large amounts of data and generate high- quality text.</p>
<p>A prompt formula is a specific format for the prompt, it is generally composed of 3 main elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>task: a clear and concise statement of what the prompt is asking the model to generate.</li>
<li>instructions: the instructions that should be followed by the model when generating text.</li>
<li>role: the role that the model should take on when generating text.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-2-instructions-prompt-technique-要求说明">Chapter 2: Instructions Prompt Technique (要求说明)</h2>
<p>The instructions prompt technique is a way of guiding the output of ChatGPT by providing specific instructions for the model to follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prompt formula: &quot;Generate [task] following these instructions: [instructions]&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Exampes:</p>
<p>Generating customer service responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task: Generate responses to customer inquiries</li>
<li>Instructions: The responses should be professional and provide accurate information</li>
<li>Prompt formula: &quot;Generate responses to customer inquiries following these instructions: The responses should be professional and provide accurate information.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The instructions should be clear and specific.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-role-prompting-定位角色">Chapter 3: Role Prompting (定位角色)</h2>
<p>The role prompting technique is useful for generating text that is tailored to a specific context or audience.
You will need to provide a clear and specific role.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prompt formula: &quot;Generate [task] as a [role]&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Generating customer service responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task: Generate responses to customer inquiries</li>
<li>Role: Customer service representative</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Prompt formula: &quot;Generate responses to customer inquiries as a customer service representative.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-4-standard-prompts-标准模式">Chapter 4: Standard Prompts (标准模式)</h2>
<p>Standard prompts are a simple way to guide the output of
ChatGPT by providing a specific task for the model to complete.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prompt formula: &quot;Generate a [task]&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Generating a summary of a news article: </p>
<ul>

<p>With minimal or no examples. These techniques are useful when there is limited data available for a specific task or when the task is new and not well-defined.</p>
<ul>
<li>The zero-shot prompting technique is used when there are no examples available for the task.</li>
<li>The one-shot prompting technique is used when there is only one example available for the task. </li>
<li>The few-shot prompting technique is used when there are a limited number of examples available for the task.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Generating a product description for a new product with no examples available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task: Write a product description for a new smartwatch</li>
<li>Prompt formula: &quot;Generate a product description for this new smartwatch with zero examples&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Generating a product comparison with one example available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task: Compare a new smartphone to the latest iPhone</li>
<li>Prompt formula: &quot;Generate a product comparison of this new smartphone with one example (latest iPhone)&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Generating a product review with few examples available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task: Write a review of a new e-reader</li>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prompt: &quot;Let&#39;s think about the impact of climate change on agriculture&quot;</li>
<li>Prompt: &quot;Let&#39;s discuss the current state of artificial intelligence&quot;</li>
<li>Prompt: &quot;Let&#39;s talk about the benefits and drawbacks of remote work&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-7-self-consistency-prompt-逻辑自恰">Chapter 7: Self-Consistency Prompt (逻辑自恰)</h2>
<p>Ensure that the output of ChatGPT is consistent with the input provided. 
This technique is useful for tasks such as fact-checking, data validation, or consistency checking in text generation.</p>
<p>The - Prompt formula: the input text followed by the instruction &quot;Please ensure the following text is self-consistent&quot;</p>
<p>Example: Text Summarization</p>
<ul>
<li>Task: Summarize a news article</li>
<li>Instructions: The summary should be consistent with the information provided in the article</li>
<li>Prompt formula: &quot;Summarize the following news article in a way that is consistent with the information provided [insert news article]&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Fact-checking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task: Check for consistency in a given news article</li>
<li>Input text: &quot;The article states that the population of the city is 5 million, but later on, it says that the population is 7 million.&quot; </li>
<li>Prompt formula: &quot;Please ensure the following text is self-consistent: The article states that the population of the city is 5 million, but later on, it says that the population is 7 million.&quot;</li>
<li>Response:  &quot;The information provided in the text is inconsistent. In one instance, it states that the population of the city is 5 million, while in another instance, it mentions that the population is 7 million. These two statements contradict each other and create a discrepancy in the information. To ensure self-consistency, the text should be revised to present a consistent population figure throughout the article.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Data validation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task: Check for consistency in a given data set</li>
<li>Input text: &quot;The data shows that the average temperature in July is 30 degrees, but the minimum temperature is recorded as 20 degrees.&quot;</li>
<li>Prompt formula: &quot;Please ensure the following text is self-consistent: The data shows that the average temperature in July is 30 degrees, but the minimum temperature is recorded as 20 degrees.&quot;</li>
<li>Response: &quot;The provided text is self-consistent. It states that the average temperature in July is 30 degrees, and it also mentions that the minimum temperature recorded during that time is 20 degrees. These two pieces of information do not contradict each other and can coexist. The average temperature represents the overall mean temperature for the month, while the minimum temperature refers to the lowest recorded temperature within that period.&quot;</li>
</ul>
